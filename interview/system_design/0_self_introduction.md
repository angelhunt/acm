介绍顺序：姓名学校专业 -> 校内表现（成绩、各种荣誉……挑闪光点说，因为你说的，待会儿可能就会变成他面的重点） -> 校外表现（实习等） -> 个人兴趣（这个optional看时间） -> 跪舔公司（哈哈这个真的必须有啊，反映出你忠心耿耿~）




牢记：自我介绍真的没那么重要，重要的是后面的问题！！！问题答得好才是硬实力，其他都是附加！最后呢，上一份本人用的英文模板，希望能给题主一点帮助。（假如是程序员应该够用了，else有些句子也是通用的~）

I am xxx from xx University, majoring in xxx, currently a junior student. (Allow me to use 3 words to describe me, quick-learning, self-discipline & easy-going.) In the past few years, I worked hard academically, winning A(B/C)-class scholarship once, which was in the top 10% of all students. 
My primary programming language is C++ and I'm fond of it. 
Although having not been participated in ACM, I often spend my leisure time on online judge such as POJ, leetcode and so forth. 
To me, solving algorithm problems is a kind of interesting game. Last year, I had an internship in eBay cloud platform team, where I did some monitoring and maintainence work on Linux virtual servers. Rather than coding and testing, what inpressed me most was the standard developing procedure of company, and surlely I gained a lot from it. I have did a variety of research project and course project in school, such as a visual teaching platform in PyQt, you can check CV for details if you are interested. And lastly, xxx is a marvelous company that I've been always dreamt about. I'm extremely interested in xxx in your company/xxx team, and also appreciate the chance of this interview. And surely I will do my best. Thank you!
